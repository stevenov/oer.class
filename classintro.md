#Class Introduction

Open Education Resources, or OERs, is a concept that's capture the imagination of faculty around the world who are looking to either find free and open resources to use with their students, or to contribute their own resources for other faculty to use.

But beyond a general sense of wanting to give students free access to high-quality course material, what does OER mean? Where can resources be found? And where can materials be placed?

This course is designed to provide a very brief overview of these issues, with the goal of getting faculty up-and-running very quickly. There is no shortage of information about OERs. The trick is finding the time to read all of it. This class, designed to be completed in around 20 minutes, is a carefully curated collection of the best links pertaining to OER.
