#Creating and Hosting Your Own Open Education Resources

Once you have found and reworked OER materials, you'll want to share what you've enhanced. The easiest way to make your content available is to an audience beyond your class is to add it to the collection where you found the material you modified. This lets other faculty see how you developed material and keeps related material together. Another advantage of submitting to the platform where you found material is that many platforms will then handle attribution for you. For instance, Connexion [will attribute work automatically when you upload into it](http://cnx.org/content/m12585/latest/content_info#cnx_attribution_header).

Faculty looking to share original work can find a platform that looks interesting. They also might consider their local institutional repository, which is often a destination for OER materials.

In general, faculty want to make sure material they wish to share is:

* **Findable**. That means including metadata about the work and the class so users will know what to expect. ENG210 can mean a lot of things, but Introduction to British Literature is more universal. OER material can be placed anywhere online, but they are usually easier to find when they're part of a collection of other OER materials.

* **Usable**. Material should be as open as possible. That means original files, like Word files, which can be more easily edited and modified than a PDF.
 
* **Licensed**. Make sure you indicate what can be done with the work and any restrictions you have, although the less restrictive the license, the better.
* 
This class is hosted in [Canvas](http://www.instructure.com/try-canvas), a free platform that facilitates open classes. These modules are built in wikis, meaning they can be edited by anyone, or only by people with a certain role in the class. Anyone looking to create an entire class, might consider it as a host for materials.
